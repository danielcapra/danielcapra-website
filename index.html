                    Hi, I'm Daniel, also known as 'shipty' online. I'm a dedicated software engineer with a passion for Swift & SwiftUI, specializing in Apple platforms, particularly iOS. I also dabble in web & back-end development when the project demands it.
                </p>
                <h4>Availability</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm always down to make new connections and discuss about potential work, hit me up at <button onclick="copyMailToClipboard()" style="all:unset;color:lightcoral;text-decoration: underline;cursor:pointer;">hi@danielcapra.com</button> & let's chat! <br/><br/>Having freelanced as a motion designer previously, I've learned to adapt and flex my skills to fit any team. Now, I'm excited to offer my expertise in the form of full-time, part-time, contract, & even freelance roles.
