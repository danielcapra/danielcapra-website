                    Hi, I'm Daniel, also known as 'shipty' online. I'm a dedicated software engineer with a passion for
                    Swift & SwiftUI, specializing in Apple platforms, particularly iOS. I also dabble in web & back-end
                    development when the project demands it.
                </p>
                <h1>Availability</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm always down to make new connections and discuss about potential work, hit me up at

                        hi@danielcapra.com
                    </button>
                    & let's chat!
                    <br /><br />
                    Having freelanced as a motion designer previously, I've learned to adapt and flex my skills to fit
                    any team. Now, I'm excited to offer my expertise in the form of full-time, part-time, contract, &
                    even freelance roles. I'm currently based in Eastern Europe, but I'm open to relocating for the
                    right opportunity, wherever it may be.
                    <br /><br />
                    Whenever I'm not working, you might catch me at local car meetups or immersed in the world of video
                    games.
